[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NLSteveO/TicTacToe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NLSteveO/TicTacToe)

## Installation
To install my Tic-Tac-Toe react app you should first install the latest version of Node. Then you will clone this repository and install the node packages.
```
git clone https://github.com/NLSteveO/TicTacToe.git
cd TicTacToe
npm install
npm start
```
*NOTE:* I highly recommend using [NVM(Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). NVM will allow you to easily use multiple versions of node and switch back and forth as needed.
