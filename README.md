# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple in browser implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, written using JavaScript and ReactJS.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NLSteveO/TicTacToe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NLSteveO/TicTacToe)

## Installation and Running
To install my Tic-Tac-Toe react app you should first install the latest version of Node. Then you will clone this repository and install the node packages.
```
git clone https://github.com/NLSteveO/TicTacToe.git
cd TicTacToe
npm install
npm start
```
**NOTE:** I highly recommend using [NVM(Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). NVM will allow you to easily use multiple versions of node and switch back and forth as needed.

## Testing and Continuous Integration
#### Linting
I am using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for my style guide linter, along with an ES9, Node and React extensions from [eslint-config-mitmaro](https://github.com/mitmaro/eslint-config-mitmaro). You can run the linter using:
```
npm run lint
```

#### Tests
I will add tests at a later time.

#### Continuous Integration
I am using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for Continuous Integration.
